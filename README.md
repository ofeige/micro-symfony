# Micro-Symfony

Silex is a micro but it is not Symfony.

Running Symfony as micro-service is exactly what i wanted.

##Symfony implementation
The implementation of the PostContext has been done with Symfony.
It has been developed with a Symfony minimal distribution inspired by:
- http://www.whitewashing.de/2014/10/26/symfony_all_the_things_web.html
