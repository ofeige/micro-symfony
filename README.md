# Micro-Symfony

I was very unsatisfied when i was offered a job position and to discover that
 instead of Symfony they were using Silex. Silex is a wonderfull but i felt
 very uncomfortable knowing i can not include any Symfony Bundle or have the
 same code structure i had with regular distribution.

 After some time i read article from Benjamin Eberlei who i truly admire
 about minimal Symfony distro that somehow spoke and presented the same thing i
 was thinking about having Symfony as micro service.

 I also would like to thank Ryan Weaver from KNP Labs who started working on
 MikroKernel and presented MikroKernelTrait that at this time i do not wish
 to implement (will explain later).
